# Machine Learning Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks explaining various machine learning concepts and Python fundamentals.

## Notebooks

### Section 2: Linear Regression

*   **`Section-2/movie_revenue.ipynb`**: Performs linear regression on movie revenue data using pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. It reads a CSV, plots the data, applies a linear regression model, and evaluates it.

### Section 3: Python Fundamentals

*   **`python/Section-3.ipynb`**: A revision of Python programming concepts with a focus on pandas DataFrames and Series. It covers reading data, accessing, adding, deleting, and operating on columns.
*   **`python/S3-Functions.ipynb`**: A tutorial on Python functions, covering their anatomy, parameters vs. arguments, positional and keyword arguments, return values, and dynamic typing.
*   **`python/S3-LSD_case_study.ipynb`**: A case study on the effect of LSD on math scores. It uses pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to perform linear regression, calculate the R-squared value, and visualize the results.
*   **`python/S3-Modules.ipynb`**: A tutorial on Python modules and packages, explaining how to use `import`, `as`, and `from ... import`.
*   **`python/S3-Objects.ipynb`**: An introduction to Python objects, covering attributes, methods, the difference between variables and objects, and dynamic typing.

### Section 4: Gradient Descent

*   **`Section-4/Gradient_Descent.ipynb`**: Explains the concept of Gradient Descent with a simple cost function. It visualizes the cost function and its derivative, and then implements the gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It also explores the effect of the initial guess on the result.
*   **`Section-4/Grad_Desc_2nd.ipynb`**: Continues with Gradient Descent, introducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a cost function for linear regression. It explains RSS vs. MSE and demonstrates their implementation. It also covers data reshaping for scikit-learn.

## Setup

To run these notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn numpy sympy
```

After installing the libraries, you can run Jupyter Notebook and open the `.ipynb` files.
